This simple example Jupyter notebook demonstrates how the notebook format allows users to interleave text, code, and results in a single file.

To execute this notebook with [Binder](https://mybinder.org), click the `launch binder` button above. Once the live demo launches, click `My_sample_notebook.ipynb` in the file listing to launch the notebook itself. In the third cell ('In [3]'), change the value of f1 to 1. Then, click `Cell > Run All`. You should see the list of numbers below the cell, and the graph below cell #4, change accordingly.
