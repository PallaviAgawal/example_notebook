# Example Jupyter notebook

[![Binder](https://mybinder.org/badge.svg)](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/jperkel/example_notebook/master)

This simple example Jupyter notebook demonstrates how the notebook format allows users to interleave text, code, and results in a single file. 

But, unless you have Jupyter notebook installed on your computer, all you can do is view the notebooks, not play with them. (See for yourself: If you click `My_sample_notebook.ipynb` above, you will be able to read the notebook, but only as a static document.) This is where [Binder](https://mybinder.org) comes in. Binder is a free, open-source, web service that packages Jupyter notebooks inside an executable container, which can be run within a web browser. 

To view a live version of this notebook, click the `launch binder` button above. Once the demo launches, click `My_sample_notebook.ipynb` in the file listing. In the fourth cell (labeled 'In [4]'), remove the leading `#` from the second call to ax.plot(). Then, click `Cell > Run All`. You should see a change in the graph below that cell.
